# barsetshire-series

This is a data visualization that shows how various topics such as gender, religion, and class appear across Anythony Trollope's
[Barsetshire series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles_of_Barsetshire); a series consisting of six novels written between 1855
and 1867.  

The vis tracks how each topic appears in each chapter---lighter bars mean that topic wasn't particulalry present in that chapter,
while darker bars suggest a stronger presence.  Topics are tracked via word frequencies---each topic has a corpus of words 
related to it, and I ran a python script to determine the frequencies of those words in each chapter of the series.

The vis should be live in early April; for now I'm still collecting data and finalizing the design.
