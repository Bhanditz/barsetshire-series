# Barsetshire Chronicles
## Visualizing word frequencies across a book series

This is a data visualization that shows how various topics such as gender, religion, and class appear across Anythony Trollope's
[Barsetshire series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles_of_Barsetshire); a series consisting of six novels written between 1855
and 1867.  


In this visualization, we look at how frequently themes come up in each chapter of the series. Each row has a theme, and each rectangle represents a chapter, and chapters are organized by book. The darker the rectangle, the more relevant that theme is to that chapter. Scroll over a rectangle to get more information.

The folder `barsetshire-data` contains all of the data and tools used to get the data.  This includes text files of all the books, as well as the programs I used to extract the data (you can see them in the `barsetshire-data/tools` folder).
