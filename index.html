			<h1>The Barsestshire Chronicles</h1>

				<p>
					From 1855 to 1867 Anthony Trollope wrote six novels that would make
					up The Barsestshire Chronicles.  This series stands as hallmark of 
					Victorian literature; considered to be Trollope's finest work, he 
					demonstrates an early form of world-building.  As characters and 
					narratives continue from one novel to the next, so does stylistic
					and thematic content.

					In this visualization, we look at how frequently themes come up 
					in each chapter of the series.  Each row has a theme, and each 
					rectangle represents a chapter, and chapters are organized by 
					book.  The darker the rectangle, the more relevant that theme is 
					to that chapter.  Scroll over a rectangle to get more information.
